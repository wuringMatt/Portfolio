            Hey there, I'm Matt Wuring, a 19-year-old software development enthusiast calling Eindhoven, The Netherlands, home. 
            Currently diving into my fourth year of studies, I'm all about coding and problem-solving. 
            From Javascript and HTML to CSS, Svelte, and Vue I've got the tech side covered. 
            What sets me apart? Well, I've got a knack for seeing the bigger picture, decent communication 
            skills, and I'm all about thinking ahead. Right now, I'm on the lookout for an internship to 
            put my skills to the test and learn even more in the real-world tech trenches. 
            So, if you're in need of someone with a mix of hard skills and a proactive mindset, 
            hit me up I'm ready to dive in! ðŸš€
